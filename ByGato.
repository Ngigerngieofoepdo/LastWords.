Hey,
If you're seeing this, then i have died, and this github is to spread info.

A while ago, i had lung cancer, i thought it's alright since.. it wasnt that big they couldve removed it until.
There was no removing it.
The reason they couldn't remove it was because the cancer cells had grown bigger.
So they just stood there, having a conversation with other doctors.
They decided to just tell me the truth, and overtime, i thought about "Eh, it'll probably be fine. They got technology right?"

And so here i am.
Laying lifeless, on a hospital bed.

Goodbye.

By gato.
